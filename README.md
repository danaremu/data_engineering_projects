# Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of **data engineering projects** that span across different areas of the data lifecycle — from **data ingestion and scraping**, to **ETL pipelines**, **data warehousing**, and **cloud-based streaming solutions**.

Each project is self-contained within its own folder and comes with a dedicated `README.md` that explains the specific purpose, tools, and implementation details of that project.

## Logging Levels

Use these levels consistently across all modules for clarity. Logging levels indicate the severity of messages:

- **[DEBUG]** → Diagnostic messages, usually turned off in production.
- **[INFO]** → Regular program flow messages, e.g., "Page loaded successfully".
- **[WARN]** → Something unusual but non-fatal, e.g., "Next button is disabled".
- **[ERROR]** → Caught exceptions or failed operations.
- **[CRITICAL]** → Unrecoverable failures, e.g., browser failed to start.

## 🚀 Project Categories

### 1. **Web Scraping**

- Located in: `TeamWaterSupporters_Scraper/`
- Demonstrates **data ingestion from websites** using Python scripts (`scraper.py`, `fetcher.py`).
- Includes:

  - Logging of errors (`error_png/`).
  - Example outputs in structured formats (CSV, JSON, etc.).
  - Support for **streaming scraping inputs** for near-real-time data collection.

### 2. **Data Warehousing & Pipelines**

- Located in: `warehousing/`
- Focused on **data storage, transformations, and pipelines** that prepare raw data for analytics or ML models.
- Submodules include:

  - `web_scraping/` → Stores outputs of scrapers before loading into the warehouse.
  - `api_connectors/` → Demonstrates ingestion from APIs (batch & streaming).
  - `real_time_etl/` → End-to-end ETL flows using streaming technologies.
  - `streaming_inputs/` → Event-driven ingestion (e.g., Kafka, Pub/Sub).

### 3. **Integration into Software & ML**

- Some pipelines are designed to **feed into downstream software systems** or serve as **data sources for ML projects**.
- Examples:

  - Scraping + preprocessing → feeding recommendation engines.
  - ETL pipelines → powering analytics dashboards.
  - Warehousing → structured datasets for ML training.

## 📌 Notes

- Each folder is **self-contained** and can be explored independently.
- Some projects may require **API keys, credentials, or cloud configurations** that are not included in the repo. Check the project-specific README for details.
- Virtual environments (`venv/`) are sometimes included per project for reproducibility, but it is recommended to use a **fresh environment** when setting up.
